## Hi!

I'm Cecilia, I have been coding for about 2 years.
(When I am not at school, I like watching the NBA, reading chinese Sci-Fi and watching Succession)
I have done the Certificate IV and the have almost finished the Diploma of Software Development at Swinburne.
I have worked mostly in C#, Javascript and done a bunch of SQL as a part of the course, as well as a large component of Project Management subjects that include using Microsoft Project, and creating behavourial and structural UML.

This year we have been giving the choice of our languages and I have found myself working more and more in React Javascript (Although when organising my GitHub for my job/Internship hunt I have realised I did really enjoy c# and I look forward to getting into Core in the future.)

I have included a list of relevant projects and assessments below. 
Each project has a detailed README.md with a full breakdown of any big issues encountered, or my specific contributions to it.

Please see below.

### 1 [DGHA Mobile App Project](https://github.com/cecpoool/DGHA.1019.git)
This project is currently ongoing and wehave just completed out first phase.
I have pulled the project from the DevOps Repo we are currently using and pushed to my own for showing experience. The README is thorough with my contributions and I am happy to provide my commit history if you would like to see it :)

### 2 [NBAi Fantasy Basketball site](https://github.com/cecpoool/NBAi-Proj.git)
This project is finished. We rebased halfway through the project and lost some important base code that was done **ON the Azure Portal.**

### 3/4 [Diploma Self-Referencing DataBase Assessment](https://github.com/cecpoool/DGHA.1019.git) and [Delegate Task](https://github.com/cecpoool/DelegatesUrgh.git)
Both of this projects are in C# and required a lot of problem solving and testing. I include them because I am proud of where I got to in both projects.

### 5 [Search and Sort in JS](https://github.com/cecpoool/AlgorMT.git)
This was just a fun project.

I am currently working on a few more assessments on Recursion and Testing which I will update here, as well as the second phase of our DGHA Mobile App.
