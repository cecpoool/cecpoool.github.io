## Hi!

I'm Cecilia, I have been coding for about 2 years.

My current skills are in:
* C# 
* Javascript(React mostly) 
* SQL 
* GraphQL 
* Agile 
* Microsoft Project 
* Enterprise Architect Modeling 
* Have played with Angular/TypeScript/Gatsby

I have included a list of relevant projects and assessments below. 
Each project has a detailed README.md with a full breakdown of any big issues encountered, or my specific contributions to it.

Please see below.

### 1 [DGHA Mobile App Project](https://github.com/cecpoool/DGHA.1019.git)
This project is currently ongoing and we have just completed our first phase.
I have pulled the project from the DevOps Repo we are currently using and pushed to my own for access. The README is thorough in regards to my contributions and I am happy to provide my commit history if you would like to see it :)

### 2 [NBAi Fantasy Basketball site](https://github.com/cecpoool/NBAi-Proj.git)
This project is finished. We rebased halfway through the project and lost some important base code that was done **ON the Azure Portal.**
:/  This is why I had to rebuild the backend.

### 3/4 [Diploma Self-Referencing DataBase Assessment](https://github.com/cecpoool/DGHA.1019.git) and [Delegate Task](https://github.com/cecpoool/DelegatesUrgh.git)
Both of these projects are in C# and required a lot of problem solving and testing. I include them because I am proud of where I got to in both projects.

### 5 [Search and Sort in JS](https://github.com/cecpoool/AlgorMT.git)
This was just a fun project.

I am currently working on a few more assessments on Recursion and Testing which I will update here, as well as the second phase of our DGHA Mobile App.
